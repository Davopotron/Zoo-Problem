        <p>

            and to provide sources on how to care for them.

    <h2>Bears</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Ollie</li>
        <li>Mona</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Ollie and Mona are our fiesty bears, who display 
        a playful show all the time!
        Watch them as they jump around for salmon! For more 
        information about bears and how to care for them,

    <h2>Giraffes</h2> 
    <ol>
        <li>Frankie</li>
        <li>Coconut</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Frankie and Coconut are suave, swanky, and cool-cat giraffes, 
        who keep a low profile inspite of their lanky stature. For more 
        information about giraffes and how to care for them, check the 
        link here:

    <h2>Lions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mella</li>
        <li>Karl</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Mella and Karl are the lazy cats in our zoo. They lounge 
        around like there's a 24/7 Schitts Creek marathon going on.

    <h2>Monkeys</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cookie</li>
        <li>Earl</li>
        <li>Banana Pudding</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Monkey see, monkey do, monkey who? That's right! we got Cookie, Earl, 
        and Banana Pudding, our 3 scandalous monkeys all wrapped up in a love 
        triangle. They're always fighting about who gets who! For more information 
        about monkeys and how to care for them, checkout the link here:

    <h2>Alligators</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wren</li>
        <li>Aspen</li>
        <li>Mika</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Rawr! says the alligator. Wren, Aspen and Mika don't play.
        Unless you wanna become their prey! Otherwise they're basking in the sun,
        island time chilling. For more information about alligators and how to care 
        for them, check out the link here:
